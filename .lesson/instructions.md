## Instructions

You will work together with a partner to build a text adventure game. [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_game)

Text games were very popular back in the day.  The day being fancy computer graphics, good sound, and now VR.

But they still have a lot of the basic elements of a good game.  You make the graphics in your mind.  Kind of like the difference between a book and a movie based on a book.

I think this a great project for a beginning programmer.  There are more than enough things to learn working on a game like this, all of which you would need to know to go further. 

I have written the harder bits, all as functions.  It is no different than using turtle functions.  I do not know or care about how turtle.right() works and you do not need to know how navigate() works in this game to navigate.

My hope is that you study navigate() and some of my functions, and try to understand what is happening, but it will do it's thing regardless :)

## How to start

To start, you need a written game description, a map, a list of all the items in your rooms, what happens when a player uses an item.
